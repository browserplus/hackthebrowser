# PromptingSample

A little known capability of BrowserPlus is the ability to render
custom HTML prompts that appear in the browser from within services.

This feature could enable all sorts of interesting applications in 
areas like:

* a better OAuth/OpenID flow
* lightweight secure access to end user information (that *stays* out
  of the reach of browser based JavaScript

This little sample demonstrates how to render custom prompts to the 
end user from inside a BrowserPlus service
