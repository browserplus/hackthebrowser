# FileAccess

FileAccess is an in production service that allows a webpage to get portions
of a file, or urls of content that an end user selects via File Browse or 
drag and drop.

This project is geared at impelmenting a fully open source version of file
access that includes new features, such as the ability to get a byte range
of a selected file and return a novel file handle.  This feature would enable
resumable uploads.

The new proposed interface, backwards compatible,  looks like this:
