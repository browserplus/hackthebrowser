# WebSocket

[Comet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)) in BrowserPlus?  Yes we can!

Steve, here. So it's Friday afternoon and I felt like doing something fun. 
Introducting bp-websocket. Browser push resurrected with BrowserPlus. Hah!

Data pushed via server is immediately seen in JavaScript callback.  Just say no to polling.

Sample command line ruby server and client included.  You can also just telnet to 
localhost:2626 for fun.
