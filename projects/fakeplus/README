Back in the day, when BrowserPlus was first meeting the world, why
the lucky stiff [took the thing apart](http://hackety.org/2008/06/09/dismantlingBrowserPlus.html).

In addition to some great ideas about how to make the BrowserPlus ruby
environment better, he produced a tiny little replica of the BrowserPlus
distribution server.  This thing is out of date, but it could be 
pretty easily updated and could be a simple way to enable tinkering 
or other things, like company internal testing or distribution servers.
