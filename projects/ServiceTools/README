# Service Tools

Some aspects of the BrowserPlus C Service API are a little tricky.  First
and foremost is mapping data into and out of the API.  This project contains
a c++ wrapper class that makes the process much easier.

As time goes on, the plan would be to aggregate other tools and frameworks
into this project and simplify the authoring of native, cross platform,
services.
