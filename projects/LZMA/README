# LZMA

LZMA is an advanced compression algorithm that's commonly found in 
installer products.  It's properties include:

1. Way [better compression](http://gist.github.com/59923).  File sizes can be 60% of what bzip2 can do.
2. Greater CPU cost for compression (than gzip or bzip)
3. Greater memory requirements for both compression and decompression (than gzip or bzip) 

These tradeoffs seem perfect for the web.  I'd rather do the compression on 
my own machine before sending the bits over the net, and decompression is
very fast, on par with bzip2.  This all suggests to me that an optimal
upload solution will involve LZMA.

The [easylzma project on github](http://lloyd.github.com/easylzma/) tames
the source into something easy to use, and is public domain.  Wrapping this
thing into a service that accepts and returns a filehandle should be a 
pretty quick project!

Any takers?
