# MusicBox

A service based on why the lucky stiff's
[bloopsaphone](http://github.com/why/bloopsaphone/tree/master),
which exposes arcade style tunes to browser based javascript.

Usage will look something like this (to play the simpsons themesong,
credit why's README):
~~~
BrowserPlus.MusicBox.play({notes: "32 + C E F# 8:A G E C - 8:A 8:F# 8:F# 8:F# 2:G"},
                          function() { /*all done playing*/);
~~~
