# Downloader

A simple ruby service to allow webpages to download remote content
locally.  This is useful in several scenarios, for instance pulling
a remote image locally for editing within ImageAlter

Usage is something like:
~~~
BrowserPlus.downloader.get({
  url: "http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3576/3332027003_0cdedd5f7f.jpg?v=0"
}, function(r) {
  if (r.success) {
    // r.value is a BrowserPlus filehandle
  }
});
~~~
