# LocalCache

This project is just an idea.

This project would be a complement to ResourceBunder.  In the case where
you want to cache restful resources for faster load times, but do not
have a large body of work that may be generally usable, you may not want
to bundle resources in 

The usage of a high level abstraction built on this could be something like
YUI's async loader:

    BPLoader.load({
       js: [ "http://foo.com/foo.js" ]
       css: [ "http://foo.com/foo.css" ]
	}, function (x) {
        // all of your resources have been loaded!  carry on
    });

The benefit of a wrapper like this is that you could use it wether or not
your users have browserplus, and it will just do the right thing.  The 
wrapper could also leverage other technologies for client side caching.
