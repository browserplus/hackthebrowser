# ResourceServer

This project is just an idea.

For improving the performance of websites, it would be cool if we
could generate little BrowserPlus services consisting of libraries of 
web resources.  Imagine if YUI could be bundled up into a versioned 
service.  

The problem here is we wouldn't want to have to build in a webserver 
every time we want to make one of these packages... So the notions of
"provider" and "dependent" services could be useful here.  The provider
called something like "ResourceServer" can be used by dependent services.
essentially all you would have to do is write a manifest.json file that
requires "ResourceServer", and pass ResourceServer an argument in that 
json file that specifies which directories are to be served.

ResourceServer: in Turn would build that packages api, which could be
something like:

    BrowserPlus.YUI.get({file:"/build/foo.js"}, function(r) {
      // r.value now contains http://localhost:15743/build/foo.js 
	});

Implementation suggestions

1. go native
2. use [mongoose](http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/)
3. Lloyd has already written [a ruby script to fetch and build mongoose](http://github.com/lloyd/bp-fileaccess/tree/01d54982f3174b85ae88515586a1fedcb0908b31/external/mongoose)
