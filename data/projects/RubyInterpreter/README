# RubyInterpreter

BrowserPlus is designed to support the notion of "provider" and
"dependent" services.  This platform feature allows interpreter
services to be written which support writing other services in 
high level languages.

The RubyInterpreter project is currently focused on building the 
next iteration of the RubyInterpreter which is based on ruby 1.9.1
and targets the following features

1. bp_require is silly, we should be able to require()
2. dependent services should be able to include native extensions
3. performance improvements (seek help to solve the "select problem")
4. upgrade to ruby 1.9.1 stable (better i18n support, etc, etc)
5. more built in extensions to the ruby environment (including the ability to use other services from a ruby service)
6. ability to ship byte compiled ruby for obfuscation (closed source code sucks, more for obfuscating api keys, and faster load times)
7. include why the lucky stiff's (in spirit at least) simplifications to writing ruby services
