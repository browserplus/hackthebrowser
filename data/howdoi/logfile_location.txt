BrowserPlus has a logfile that captures inforamation while it's running.
Including some part of this logfile in problem reports helps us to 
diagnose many problems.  The logfile lives in a _user scoped_ location
on your disk, and that location is platform dependent.

On OSX 10.4 to 10.6 you can find the logfile here:

    ~/Library/Application Support/Yahoo!/BrowserPlus/<version>/<guid>/*.log

On Windows XP you can find the logs in:

    C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Local Settings\Application Data\Yahoo!\BrowserPlus\<version>\<guid>\*.log

Finally on Windows Vista and Windows 7, your logfiles can be found here:

    C:\Users\<user>\AppData\LocalLow\Yahoo!\BrowserPlus\<version>\<guid>\*.log
