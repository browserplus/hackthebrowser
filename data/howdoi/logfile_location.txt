BrowserPlus has a logfile that captures information while it's
running.  Including this logfile in problem reports can help the
reader to diagnose many issues.  The logfile lives in a _user scoped_
location on your disk, and that location is platform dependent.

On OSX 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6 you can find the logfile here:

    ~/Library/Application Support/Yahoo!/BrowserPlus/<version>/<guid>/*.log

On Windows XP you can find the logs in:

    C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Local Settings\Application Data\Yahoo!\BrowserPlus\<version>\<guid>\*.log

Finally on Windows Vista and Windows 7, your logfiles can be found here:

    C:\Users\<user>\AppData\LocalLow\Yahoo!\BrowserPlus\<version>\<guid>\*.log
