Currently we don't have any built in mechanisms to require a certain platform version, nor force an update.

But you can do it at the page level with [getPlatformInfo()](http://browserplus.yahoo.com/developer/web/api/#bpgetplatforminfo).

This will let you get the platform version, and appropriately message the end user, or refuse to run the page.

Alternatively, you should see that your regular users are updated within 48 hours if they use your service at least once a day, I'll dig up and repost the precise update logic in browserplus to give you a concrete idea how it works
