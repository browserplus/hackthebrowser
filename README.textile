h2. What?

hackthebrowser.org is a repository of open source work happening
that's related to BrowserPlus.  This repository contains the site 
code for HackTheBrowser.org.

h2. Why?

We've got a ton of ideas about what we want to grow HackTheBrowser
into, like it should be drag and drop easy to publish a service 
to HTB.  Then HTB would be a full fledged development repository of 
services that you could point BrowserPlus at.

Currently, however, the site is a simple static index of BrowserPlus
services, and a repository of our public IRC chatter.

So wanna add a project?  Just fork us.
